        </div>
        
        <div class="content-body">
            <p>The Blue Mountain community was established in 1975 when developers recognized the unique appeal of this beautiful mountain setting. The development was designed to preserve much of the natural landscape while creating parcels for mountain homes with spectacular views.</p>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <h3>HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                
                <p>Blue Mountain was developed in phases, with the initial roads and infrastructure laid out to maximize the natural beauty of the terrain. The Sanitary District was established to ensure ongoing maintenance of these private roads and community amenities.</p>
                
                <p>Over the decades, the community has grown steadily, with a mix of year-round residents and weekend/vacation homeowners. Many of the original homes have been renovated and expanded, while new construction continues as remaining lots are developed.</p>
                
                <h3>COMMUNITY CHARACTER</h3>
                
                <p>Since its inception, Blue Mountain has maintained a commitment to preserving its natural environment and fostering a strong sense of community. Unlike many modern subdivisions, Blue Mountain has retained much of its original wooded character, with homes nestled among mature trees on spacious lots.</p>
                
                <p>The community's founding principles continue to guide its development, with an emphasis on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respecting the natural landscape</li>
                    <li>Maintaining privacy between homes</li>
                    <li>Preserving wildlife habitat</li>
                    <li>Creating a close-knit community through shared spaces and activities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4 class="highlight-box-title">BLUE MOUNTAIN NAME ORIGIN</h4>
                <p>The name "Blue Mountain" reflects the distinctive blue haze that often appears to envelope the mountain ranges in this region. This phenomenon is caused by natural isoprene emissions from trees that scatter blue light from the sun, creating the characteristic blue appearance that's especially noticeable from a distance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Today, Blue Mountain stands as a testament to thoughtful development that balances human habitation with environmental preservation, creating a community where residents can enjoy the beauty and tranquility of mountain living while maintaining convenient access to nearby towns and cities.</p>
