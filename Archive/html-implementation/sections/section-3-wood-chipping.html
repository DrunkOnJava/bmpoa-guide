            <h3>FREE ANNUAL WOOD CHIPPING</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>All property owners within the BMPOA Sanitary District are eligible for free wood chipping annually. This valuable service helps reduce fire hazards around homes while providing a convenient way to dispose of woody debris.</p>

                    <h4 class="highlight-box-title">FIRE PREVENTION BENEFIT</h4>
                    <p>Property owners are highly encouraged to participate in the cleanup as it helps reduce the risk and impact of fire events on our mountain. Removing dead branches, brush, and small trees creates defensible space around your homeâ€”one of the most effective wildfire protection strategies.</p>

            <h3>PARTNERSHIP WITH VIRGINIA FORESTRY</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>The wood-chipping program is conducted in partnership with the Virginia Department of Forestry as part of their wildfire prevention efforts. This collaboration reflects the recognition of Blue Mountain as a Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) area where homes are interspersed with natural vegetation that can fuel wildfires.</p>
                
                <p>Benefits of this partnership include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to professional equipment and expertise</li>
                    <li>Cost-sharing that makes the program financially sustainable</li>
                    <li>Educational resources on creating defensible space</li>
                    <li>Follow-up assessments and recommendations</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>CHIPPING SCHEDULE</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>Wood chipping typically occurs in early spring to ensure that severe weather known to cause deadfall has passed. The process spans over a week and will be announced several weeks in advance on the website and community Facebook groups.</p>
                
                <p>The timing is strategic to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow residents to clean up winter debris</li>
                    <li>Prepare properties before spring growth begins</li>
                    <li>Create defensible spaces before the spring fire season</li>
                    <li>Accommodate both weekend and full-time residents</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="two-column">
                <p>Proper preparation of your brush pile is essential for efficient chipping. Follow these guidelines to ensure your debris can be processed:</p>

                    <h4 class="checklist-title">BRUSH PILE CHECKLIST</h4>
                    <div class="checklist-item">Establish a brush pile within 5 feet of the roadside for easy access</div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">Place all cut ends facing the same direction, toward the road</div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">Keep pile height under 4 feet for stability and safety</div>

                    <div class="checklist-item">Limit branch lengths to 12 feet maximum</div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">Ensure piles are free of wire, nails, rope, and other non-wood materials</div>

                    <li>Lumber, treated wood, or construction debris</li>
                    <li>Root balls with dirt and rocks</li>

            <h3>YEAR-ROUND PREPARATION</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>Starting early and consistently collecting brush year-round is considered good practice. This approach offers several advantages:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Spreads the workload throughout the year rather than creating a time-consuming project right before chipping</li>
                    <li>Allows dead branches and trees to be removed promptly when identified</li>
                    <li>Creates ongoing improvement to your property's defensible space</li>
                    <li>Reduces the amount of winter storm damage that needs sudden cleanup</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Many residents maintain a designated brush collection area on their property that they add to throughout the year, then move the materials to the roadside when chipping time approaches.</p>

                <p>The exact dates for the wood-chipping program will be announced through multiple channels including the BMPOA website, Facebook groups, emails to registered property owners, and signs posted at key locations on the mountain. Watch for these announcements in late winter/early spring so you can prepare your brush piles in time.</p>

            <h3>WOOD CHIP AVAILABILITY</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>The wood-chipping program generates large quantities of wood chips that are available to Blue Mountain residents at no charge. These chips can be valuable resources for:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Landscaping and garden mulch</li>
                    <li>Erosion control on steep slopes</li>
                    <li>Path creation through wooded areas</li>
                    <li>Suppressing weeds around ornamental plants</li>
                    <li>Composting (when mixed with nitrogen-rich materials)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Wood chips are available in two ways: direct delivery to your property during the chipping process or pickup from community stockpile locations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>DIRECT DELIVERY OPTIONS</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>Surplus wood chips are typically available for delivery to your property during the chipping process, free of charge. When the chipping crew comes to process your brush pile, you can request that they leave the resulting chips rather than hauling them away.</p>
                
                <p>You can also arrange for delivery of chips from other properties if you need more than your own brush pile will generate. This is particularly useful for residents with landscaping projects that require substantial amounts of mulch.</p>

            <h3>COMMUNITY ACCESS POINTS</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>Wood chips are also available at communal stockpile locations for any homeowners in need. These locations are accessible year-round, not just during the chipping season:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lodge Parking Area:</strong> A pile is maintained near the Blue Mountain Lodge at 540 Cliff Road</li>
                    <li><strong>Dam Parking Area at Deer Lake:</strong> Chips are available at the parking area near the dam</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When taking chips from these communal piles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring your own containers, tarps, or truck</li>
                    <li>Take only what you need</li>
                    <li>Clean up any spillage</li>
                    <li>Consider returning in multiple smaller trips for large projects</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4 class="info-box-title">LANDSCAPING TIP</h4>
                <p>Fresh wood chips will temporarily tie up nitrogen in the soil as they decompose. If using chips around plants, consider adding a nitrogen-rich fertilizer or keeping the chips a few inches away from plant stems. For vegetable gardens, it's best to use well-aged chips that have already begun to decompose.</p>
