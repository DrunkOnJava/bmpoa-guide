PROJECT OVERVIEW
============================================

This project plan verifies all previously marked "‚úì Done" tasks for pages 1-78, then defines updated tasks for pages 79-100. Each phase corresponds to discrete sections of the PDF.

Key Enhancement Goals:
- Standardize typography hierarchy throughout (16pt section banners, 12pt subheads, 11pt body, 10pt captions)
- Ensure exact 0.75" margins and 0.30" gutters on two-column layouts
- Apply uniform table styling: 0.5pt slate-gray borders, 11pt forest-green header on #F3F4F6 (or white on forest-green), 10pt body with alternating #F9FAFB shading, 4pt√ó6pt padding
- Enforce consistent icon sizing and vertical centering (16√ó16px for subhead icons; 12√ó12px for inline icons)
- Standardize call-out box styles: info (#F5F5F5 bg, 0.5pt #4B5563 border, 6pt padding), warning/legal (#FEF2F2 bg, 1pt red border, 6pt padding)
- Verify each footer: 1pt slate-gray line 0.10" above "BMPOA Community Guide X" (8pt gray #6B7280) flush-left and "www.bmpoa.org" flush-right

============================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
============================================

1. Verify Complete Tasks: A manual review of pages 1-78 confirms all "‚úì Done" items are correctly implemented.
2. Continue Sequential Phases: Complete Phase 4 tasks (pages 79-100) in order of priority.
3. Regenerate PDF Frequently: After finishing any major component (e.g., call-out box or table), run npm run pdf to confirm the output matches expected styling.
4. Keep pageNumberMap.json Updated: Because multiple reflows occurred, ensure TOC and internal links remain accurate.
5. Use Shared Components & Theme: Leverage DesignComponents.js and theme.js for color and spacing constants to maintain strict consistency.
6. Maintain NoJSX Pattern: When modifying React components, continue using React.createElement rather than JSX.
7. Coordinate with Assets Script: If you add or replace icons/images, update scripts/scan-assets.js so asset mapping remains correct.
8. Check Container Widths: Any new call-out boxes or tables must not exceed the 0.75" margin; verify they align to the same grid used elsewhere.
