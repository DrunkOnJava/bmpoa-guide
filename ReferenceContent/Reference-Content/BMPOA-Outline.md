Below is the fully revised, comprehensive outline for the BMPOA booklet. Any content that originated from the accidental “notes” (e.g., the “Lodge or Rental Questions?” paragraph, the extra open‐burning reminder, and the “About Blue Mountain Rescue Brigade” / “About The purpose of this forum” blocks) has been removed. The outline now reflects only the intended sections and text.

  2. **Pre-Construction Requirements:**

     * Before applying for any Warren County building permit or zoning variance, owner must notify ARC Chair (include contractors/agents). Submit in writing via return-receipt mail. ARC Chair (or designee) will respond in writing within 30 days with:

        a. Approval

        b. Disapproval (with reasons)

        c. Request for additional information (owner then has 30 days to supply; ARC has 30 days to respond). If no response in 30 days, deemed approved.

     * Construction may not begin until building site plan and detailed plans (materials list, tree removal plan) are approved in writing by ARC. Any deviation from approved plans risks legal action.

     * Construction must be sited unobtrusively—use natural flora to screen from access roads. Only remove trees needed for foundation, septic field, and driveway unless extra clearing is approved. All exterior work (painting, siding) completed within one year of start.

  3. **Building Requirements:**

     * One detached single-family dwelling, one private garage, and one accessory building per lot allowed.

     * Garage/accessory building must match primary structure’s design and materials

     * Trees felled during construction must be staged unobtrusively or removed. ARC may allow limited scenic view clearing but not extensive clearing.

     * No permanent outside outhouses allowed.

  4. **Building on an Unpaved Road:**

     * Lot developer must construct roadway within platted easement to BMPOA specs (3″ compacted \#3 gravel base \+ 2″ crusher run surface; 10 ft width between ditches; proper grading/crowning; culverts at low points).

     * Once inspected/accepted by BMPOA Road Committee, maintenance assumed by BMPOA.

  5. **Accessory Building Requirements & Restrictions:**

       * **Foundations & Additions:**

         * Accessory buildings (on pilings, skids, slabs) must be in side/rear yard

         * Within 4 ft of primary structure, considered an addition: requires County permit and must meet primary structure setbacks/height

     * ARC approval required even after County approval; violations subject to legal action.

  6. **Fence Requirements:**

     * Only split-rail fences allowed. Submit design/materials plan to ARC for written approval. Exceptions case-by-case based on compatibility.

   **Wood‐Chipping Community Effort**

  1. All property owners within BMPOA Sanitary District are eligible for free wood chipping annually to reduce fire risk.

  2. Surplus wood chips delivered free of charge to homeowner property during chipping week; extra chips dumped at The Lodge and Deer Lake dam parking areas for pickup.

  3. Email wood-chipping coordinator at jcook0313@gmail.com to schedule free delivery.

  4. Chipping typically occurs early spring (duration \~1 week), announced weeks in advance via BMPOA.org, newsletter, and Facebook group.

  5. **Brush Pile Guidelines:**

      • Place brush within 5 ft of roadside.

      • Branches ≤ 8″ diameter and ≤ 12 ft length.

      • Remove rocks, metal, trash—only clean wood/brush.

      • Collect year-round to minimize accumulation.

  6. BMPOA partners with VA Dept. of Forestry for fire mitigation and evacuation planning.

* **Sub-Bullets (clarification):**

  1. **Eligibility & Enrollment:**

     * All BMPOA property owners in good standing (dues/taxes paid) automatically eligible; no reservations needed—simply place brush as directed.

  2. **Pickup & Delivery:**

     * Email jcook0313@gmail.com to arrange surplus chip delivery.

     * Chips available for pickup at The Lodge parking area or Deer Lake dam parking area (first-come, first-served).

  3. **Brush Preparation:**

     * Cut branches into ≤ 8″ diameter and ≤ 12 ft length.

     * Stack loosely within 5 ft of roadway; do not block roads or driveways.

     * Remove all non-wood debris.

  4. **Fire Mitigation Partnership:**

     * VA Dept. of Forestry provides guidance on defensible space, evacuation routes.

     * BMPOA Roads Committee and Public Safety Committee coordinate on community evacuation zones.

### **Section 15 – Bear Safety**

* **Heading:** Bear Safety on the Mountain

* **Sections & Subsections:**

  1. **Understanding Bear Behavior:**

     * Black bears are intelligent and typically avoid humans; most conflicts occur because they seek out food attractants, not out of aggression.

  2. **Common Bear Attractants:**

     * Bird feeders (April–November)

     * Unsecured garbage cans left outdoors

     * Pet food on porches or yards

     * Grills with residual grease or scraps

     * Fruit trees (ripe or fallen fruit)

     * Compost piles containing meat, bones, or fatty kitchen scraps

     * Coolers, trash, or scented items stored on porches/decks

  3. **Preventive Actions for Homeowners:**

     * Remove bird feeders during active season or switch to bear-resistant models.

     * Store garbage in locked garage, shed, or bear-proof container; never leave trash outdoors overnight.

     * Feed pets indoors; clean up any food scraps immediately.

     * Clean grills after each use (burn off grease for 5 minutes, then cover).

     * Use electric fencing around beehives, compost piles, and gardens.

     * Harvest ripe fruit promptly; remove fallen fruit daily.

     * Do not store any food or scented items on porches/decks.

     * Compost responsibly—no meat, bones, or fatty scraps; use enclosed compost bins if possible.

  4. **Hazing & Deterrents:**

     * **Safe Hazing Methods:**

       * Paintballs aimed at the bear’s rump (non-lethal, safe deterrent)

       * Loud noises: air horns, shouting, banging pots/pans

       * Motion-activated noise or lighting devices

       * Always maintain an escape route—never corner a bear

  5. **Community Cooperation:**

     * Discuss bear-safe practices with neighbors; collective effort reduces conflicts.

     * Feeding bears (intentionally or not) is illegal under Virginia Code (placing food, minerals, or trash to attract bears). Violators face fines and potential legal action.

  6. **If You Encounter a Bear:**

     * **In Your Yard or Home:**

       * Remain calm—do not run (running can trigger chase response).

       * Identify an exit route; back away slowly while making noise.

       * If indoors, open doors to allow bear to exit; do not trap it.

     * **While Hiking:**

       * Hike in groups; make noise around corners and dense vegetation.

       * Keep children close and dogs leashed.

       * If surprised at close range, speak calmly, back away slowly, and give the bear space. Avoid direct eye contact.

       * If a bear charges: use bear spray if available; if contact is imminent, fight back using sticks, rocks, or your fists—aim for sensitive areas (nose, eyes).

  7. **Bear Behavior Myths Debunked:**

     * Bears stand on hind legs to see/smell better—not always aggression.

     * Black bears’ diet is \~80% plant-based (berries, nuts, insects).

     * A mother with cubs usually flees or climbs a tree when threatened; attacks are rare if given space.

     * Bears communicate via body language and sounds; they have good color vision and detect movement well.

     * Relocating a problem bear often leads another to move into the vacated territory—address attractants instead.

  8. **Contacts & Resources:**

     * Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources (DWR) Wildlife Conflict Hotline: (804) 367-1000

     * Warren County Animal Control (for pet/livestock threats): (540) 636-7834

     * BMPOA Emergency Coordinator (wildlife issues): \[Name / Phone / Email\]
