\infobox{Getting Started with Native Plants}{
\textbf{Start Small:} Begin with a few native plants in areas where you want to reduce maintenance. Native plants are generally more drought-tolerant and require less fertilizer once established.

\textbf{Consider Your Site:} Match plants to your specific conditions (sun, shade, wet, dry). Native plants are adapted to local conditions but still need appropriate placement to thrive.

\textbf{Plan for Seasons:} Choose a mix of plants that provide interest throughout the year – spring flowers, summer blooms, fall color, and winter structure.

\textbf{Support Wildlife:} Include plants that provide nectar for pollinators, seeds for birds, and host plants for butterfly caterpillars. Native plants support 35 times more butterfly and moth species than non-native plants.

\chapter*{Bear Safety in Blue Mountain}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bear Safety}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=yellow!10,
  colframe=yellow!75!black,
  title={\sffamily\bfseries Living with Black Bears},
  fonttitle=\bfseries\sffamily,
  boxrule=2pt
]
Black bears are native residents of the Blue Ridge Mountains and an important part of our forest ecosystem. While bear encounters are relatively rare, understanding bear behavior and taking proper precautions helps ensure the safety of both residents and wildlife. Following these guidelines helps maintain the natural balance that makes Blue Mountain special.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Understanding Black Bear Behavior}

\subsection*{Natural Behavior \& Habitat}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Omnivorous Diet:} Bears eat berries, nuts, insects, small animals, and vegetation
\item \textbf{Excellent Senses:} Bears have exceptional hearing and smell (7 times better than bloodhounds)
\item \textbf{Typically Shy:} Bears naturally avoid humans and prefer undisturbed forest areas
\item \textbf{Seasonal Activity:} Most active spring through fall; hibernate in winter
\item \textbf{Territory Range:} Adult bears may travel 5-15 miles seeking food and mates
\item \textbf{Swimming Ability:} Bears are excellent swimmers and may cross Deer Lake
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Seasonal Activity Patterns}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=blue!5,
  colframe=blue!75!black,
  title={\sffamily\bfseries Spring (March - May)},
  fonttitle=\bfseries\sffamily,
  boxrule=1pt
]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=2pt]
\item Bears emerge from winter dens, often hungry
\item Mothers with new cubs are especially protective\hfill
\item Increased activity near water sources
\item Natural food sources still limited
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=green!5,
  colframe=green!75!black,
  title={\sffamily\bfseries Summer (June - August)},
  fonttitle=\bfseries\sffamily,
  boxrule=1pt
]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=2pt]
\item Abundant natural foods available
\item Bears focus on berries and insects
\item Less likely to approach human areas
\item Most active during early morning and evening\hfill
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=orange!5,
  colframe=orange!75!black,
  title={\sffamily\bfseries Fall (September - November)},
  fonttitle=\bfseries\sffamily,
  boxrule=1pt
]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=2pt]
\item Hyperphagia: bears eat constantly to gain winter weight
\item More aggressive food-seeking behavior
\item Increased risk of property encounters
\item Oak acorns and other nuts primary food sources\hfill
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=gray!5,
  colframe=gray!75!black,
  title={\sffamily\bfseries Winter (December - February)},
  fonttitle=\bfseries\sffamily,
  boxrule=1pt
]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=2pt]
\item Bears hibernate in dens (caves, hollow trees)
\item Minimal activity except warm winter days
\item Cubs born during hibernation
\item Rare but possible encounters on warm days
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Bear-Proofing Your Property}

\subsection*{Eliminate Food Sources}

The most important step in bear safety is removing food attractants from your property.

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=red!5,
  colframe=red!75!black,
  title={\sffamily\bfseries Garbage \& Food Storage},
  boxrule=1pt,
  left=2mm,
  right=2mm
]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Use bear-resistant garbage containers or store in garage/shed
\item Put garbage out only on collection day morning
\item Clean containers regularly to eliminate odors
\item Store pet food indoors in sealed containers
\item Remove bird feeders from April through November
\item Clean outdoor grills after each use
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=red!5,
  colframe=red!75!black,
  title={\sffamily\bfseries Landscaping \& Gardens},
  boxrule=1pt,
  left=2mm,
  right=2mm
]
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Harvest fruits and vegetables promptly
\item Remove fallen fruit from trees immediately
\item Consider electric fencing around gardens
\item Avoid berry-producing plants near homes
\item Compost bins should be properly secured or indoor only
\item Remove bee hives or secure with electric fencing
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Property Security Measures}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Motion-Activated Lights:} Install around garbage areas, decks, and entry points
\item \textbf{Secure Doors \& Windows:} Ensure all openings can be securely closed
\item \textbf{Remove Cover:} Clear brush near homes to reduce hiding spots
\item \textbf{Fence Maintenance:} Repair holes or gaps that could provide access
\item \textbf{Vehicle Security:} Lock cars and remove any food items
\item \textbf{Deck \& Porch Storage:} Avoid storing attractants in accessible outdoor areas
\end{itemize}

\section*{If You Encounter a Bear}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
  colback=red!10,

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XX}
\hline
\textbf{\color{green!70!black}DO These Things} & \textbf{\color{red!70!black}DON'T Do These Things} \\
\hline
\textbf{Stay Calm:} Avoid sudden movements or loud noises &
\textbf{Don't Run:} Bears can run 30+ mph and may chase \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Back Away Slowly:} Give the bear plenty of space &
\textbf{Don't Turn Your Back:} Keep bear in sight while backing away \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Appear Large:} Raise arms or jacket above your head &
\textbf{Don't Feed or Approach:} Never offer food or try to get closer \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Speak Calmly:} Talk in normal tones so bear knows you're human &
\textbf{Don't Panic:} Loud screaming may provoke defensive behavior\hfill \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Avoid Eye Contact:} Bears may interpret staring as aggression &
\textbf{Don't Climb Trees:} Black bears are excellent climbers\hfill \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Move to Shelter:} Slowly back toward building or vehicle\hfill &
\textbf{Don't Surprise Bears:} Make noise when walking in woods \\[0.2cm]
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Specific Encounter Scenarios}

\textbf{Bear at Distance (50+ yards)}\\
Back away slowly while keeping bear in sight. Most bears will leave the area once they detect humans. Make noise to alert bear to your presence if it hasn't noticed you.

\textbf{Bear on Property}\\
Go indoors immediately. Wait for bear to leave naturally. Make noise from inside (bang pots, shout) to encourage departure. Do not go outside until bear is completely gone.

\textbf{Bear with Cubs}\\
Extremely dangerous situation. Mother bears are highly protective. Give maximum distance possible. Never get between mother and cubs. Back away very slowly and seek immediate shelter.

\textbf{Aggressive Bear Behavior}\\
If bear approaches aggressively, make yourself appear larger, make loud noises, throw objects (not at bear). Fight back if contacted - black bears may be deterred by aggressive human response.

\textbf{Before Moving In:} Contact utility providers 2-3 weeks in advance to schedule service connections. Some services may require several days for activation.

\textbf{Address Verification:} Ensure service providers have your correct address including any road name variations (some GPS systems may not have current Blue Mountain addresses).

\textbf{Service Bundling:} Many providers offer discounts for bundling services (internet + TV, electric + propane). Compare total costs when making decisions.

\textbf{Neighbor Recommendations:} Talk to neighbors about their experience with different service providers. Local knowledge is valuable for understanding coverage and reliability.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{History \& Founding Principles}

\begin{center}
\textit{Five Decades of Mountain Community}
\end{center}

\section*{The Beginning: Late 1950s}

Blue Mountain's story begins in the late 1950s when a group of Washington D.C. area residents envisioned a mountain retreat where families could escape the city's heat and congestion. They found the perfect location on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains, just 70 miles from the nation's capital.

Created in the late 1950's as a vacation community for Washington D.C. residents, 
Blue Mountain is now a mix of summer residents and year-round families. 
Renowned for scenic overlooks, seasonal wildflowers, and a peaceful mountain retreat, 
the subdivision is a Sanitary District in Warren County, managed by an elected volunteer executive board.

===========================================
✅ Fixes applied.

Next steps (in the same folder):

  cd ~/Documents/latex-version-copy
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode main_clean.tex
  xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode main_clean.tex

That will generate a full-fledged “main_clean.pdf” without the image‐inclusion errors.
