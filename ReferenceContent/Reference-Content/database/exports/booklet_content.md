### Welcome to Blue Mountain

Dear Neighbor,

On behalf of the Blue Mountain Property Owners Association Board of Directors, we warmly welcome you to our mountain community. Whether you are a new resident, a longtime homeowner, or a visitor, we are delighted you are here.

Blue Mountain has been a special place since the late 1950s, when it was established as a vacation retreat for Washington, D.C. area residents seeking clean mountain air and peaceful surroundings. Today, we are a vibrant mix of seasonal and year-round families who share a commitment to preserving the natural beauty and neighborly spirit that make our community unique.

This guide provides comprehensive information about living in Blue Mountain, from governance and community services to recreational opportunities and safety guidelines. We encourage you to reference it often and to participate actively in our community life.

We look forward to seeing you at community events, board meetings, and around the mountain. Together, we continue the tradition of stewardship and fellowship that has defined Blue Mountain for over six decades.

Sincerely,
The BMPOA Board of Directors

### Bear Safety on the Mountain

Black bears are intelligent and typically avoid humans. Most conflicts occur because bears seek food attractants, not out of aggression.

#### Common Bear Attractants

• Bird feeders (remove April-November)
• Unsecured garbage cans
• Pet food on porches
• Grills with residual grease
• Fruit trees (ripe or fallen fruit)
• Compost with meat/bones/fat
#### If You Encounter a Bear

At Home:

  • Remain calm - do not run
  • Back away slowly while making noise
  • If indoors, open doors to allow bear to exit
While Hiking:

  • Make noise around corners and dense vegetation
  • Keep children close and dogs leashed
  • If charged, use bear spray or fight back targeting nose/eyes
