### Common Formatting Issues

1. **Excessive White Space** (Critical Priority):
   - Page 5: Introduction with only 2 bullet points
   - Page 8: Single line of text
   - Page 14: Two lines of text
   - Page 21: Single tip box
   - Page 27: Minimal emergency contacts
   - Page 44: Two bullet points only

2. **Blank Pages** (Critical Priority):
   - Page 37: Completely blank
   - Page 42: Completely blank

3. **Section Dividers** (Medium Priority):
   - 7 full-page section dividers that could incorporate content
   - Pages: 6, 11, 17, 22, 28, 33, 38

4. **Typography Issues**:
   - Generally consistent
   - Good use of headers and body text
   - Proper hierarchy maintained

5. **Alignment Issues**:
   - Most enhanced pages have good alignment
   - Tables and boxes are well-formatted

### Priority Fixes Needed

**CRITICAL (Immediate Action Required):**
1. Remove blank pages (37, 42)
2. Combine pages with minimal content:
   - Page 5 + 6 (Introduction + Section divider)
   - Page 8 with page 7 (Governance content)
   - Page 14 with page 13 (Mountain Home content)
   - Page 21 with page 20 (Wood chip content)
   - Page 27 with page 26 (Emergency content)
   - Page 44 with page 43 (Lodge guidelines)

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. Integrate section dividers with first content page of each section
2. Review all pages with <25% content utilization

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
1. Standardize box and callout styling
2. Ensure consistent spacing between sections
3. Review image sizing for optimal space usage

### Estimated Page Reduction
By implementing these fixes, the document could be reduced by approximately 12-15 pages in the 5-44 range, improving from 40 pages to approximately 25-28 pages while maintaining all content and improving readability.
