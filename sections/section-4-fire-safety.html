            <p>Blue Mountain's wooded environment, while beautiful, presents significant wildfire risks that all community members should be aware of. Our location in a Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) area means homes are interspersed with forests, increasing vulnerability to wildfires.</p>

                    <p><strong>High Risk Areas</strong><br>
                    Steep slopes, areas with dense vegetation, properties with unmaintained defensible space, and homes with wooden decks/roofs are at highest risk.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Moderate Risk Areas</strong><br>
                    Properties with partial defensible space, some vegetation management, and homes with some fire-resistant features but remaining vulnerabilities.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Lower Risk Areas</strong><br>
                    Properties with well-maintained defensible space (at least 30ft), fire-resistant landscaping, and homes with fire-resistant roofing and construction.</p>

                <p><strong>Open burning is forbidden at all times within BMPOA boundaries</strong>, even if Warren County lifts a burn ban. Warren County Code § 974.3575 prohibits burning within 300 ft of woods/dry grass before 4 PM. BMPOA prohibits open burning entirely. Violations are a Class 3 misdemeanor with fines up to $500 plus suppression costs.</p>

            <div class="two-column">
                <p>If time permits when you first become aware of an approaching wildfire:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove all combustible material (doormats, grills, firewood, etc.) at least 30-50 feet from your home</li>
                    <li>Wet gutters and foundation areas to reduce ignition risk</li>
                    <li>Leave connected garden hoses and buckets of water around the exterior for firefighters</li>
                    <li>Place aluminum ladders outside for firefighter roof access</li>
                    <li>Leave electricity on to power well pumps and lights</li>
                    <li>Turn off central heating/air conditioning systems</li>
                    <li>Leave doors and windows closed but unlocked for firefighters' access</li>

            <h3>EVACUATION ALERT LEVELS</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p><strong>Level 1 – READY:</strong> Be aware of danger in your area. Monitor emergency services websites and local media. Pack essential items and prepare to leave if necessary.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Level 2 – SET:</strong> There is significant danger in your area. Be prepared to leave at a moment's notice. Consider voluntarily relocating to a safe area.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Level 3 – GO:</strong> Imminent danger exists. Leave immediately. Delay puts your life at risk. Do not return until officials declare the area safe.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="alert-box">
                <h4 class="alert-box-title">CRITICAL REMINDER</h4>
                <p>Remember that no possession is worth risking your life. Evacuate early and stay safe. Material possessions can be replaced—people cannot.</p>

                <h4 class="highlight-box-title">10 TIPS FOR KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE IN A HOME FIRE</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Teach children fire is a tool, not a toy; demonstrate safe behavior around heat sources</li>
                    <li>Install smoke alarms near kitchen, each level, and in bedrooms; test monthly, replace batteries yearly; teach children the alarm sound</li>
                    <li>Introduce children to local firefighters so they're not scared by gear and masks</li>
                    <li>Keep matches and lighters out of reach or locked in a cabinet; use child-resistant mechanisms</li>
                    <li>Never leave children unattended near stoves, candles, or fireplaces</li>
                    <li>Teach children to call 9-1-1; post emergency numbers and address near every phone</li>
                    <li>Practice fire drills twice a year (including at night) so children know primary/secondary escape routes</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate how to escape a smoke-filled room by crawling on the floor to the nearest exit</li>
                    <li>Emphasize "Get out and stay out": do not re-enter once safe; call for help from outside</li>
                    <li>Teach STOP-DROP-and-ROLL if clothes catch fire: stop immediately, drop covering face, and roll until fire is out</li>
