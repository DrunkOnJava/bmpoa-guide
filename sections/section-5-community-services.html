            <p>Blue Mountain's road network presents unique challenges, particularly during winter weather. Understanding road maintenance procedures and winter weather guidelines will help you navigate safely throughout the year.</p>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <h3>ROAD MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
                
                <p>Blue Mountain's roads are privately owned and maintained by the BMPOA through Sanitary District funds, with the exception of:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fire Trail Road:</strong> This road is NOT owned or maintained by BMPOA. For concerns, contact VDGIF Region 4 Board of Directors.</li>
                    <li><strong>State-Maintained Roads:</strong> Certain connecting roads like portions of Blue Mountain Road and Freezeland Road are maintained by VDOT.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The BMPOA Roads Committee oversees maintenance, which includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular grading of gravel roads</li>
                    <li>Pothole filling</li>
                    <li>Drainage management</li>
                    <li>Winter weather response</li>
                    <li>Vegetation control along roadways</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="alert-box">
                <h4 class="alert-box-title">SALT USE PROHIBITED</h4>
                <p>The use of salt on all gravel roads within BMPOA is strictly prohibited as it damages the roadbed and increases maintenance costs for the community. Use approved alternatives for traction instead.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>WINTER TRACTION OPTIONS</h3>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <p><strong>Gravel Chips:</strong> Look for blue poly barrels placed on hills for traction assistance. These barrels contain crushed gravel that can be spread on slippery areas to improve traction. After use, please notify the Roads Committee so barrels can be refilled as needed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Tire Chains:</strong> A great option when road conditions are poor. Ensure they fit your vehicle and practice installation in advance. Modern cable chains are generally easier to install than traditional link chains and usually provide adequate traction for Blue Mountain's roads.</p>

        <div class="content-body">
            <p>Access to reliable internet service is increasingly important for both full-time and part-time residents. Due to our mountain location, service options can vary based on your specific location within Blue Mountain.</p>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <h3>AVAILABLE PROVIDERS</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Xfinity/Comcast:</strong> Cable internet service is available in many parts of Blue Mountain, offering relatively high-speed options. Contact them at 1-855-399-1542 to check availability at your specific address.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Starlink (SpaceX):</strong> Satellite internet service is available throughout the entire community, regardless of terrain or tree coverage. While requiring an initial equipment investment, it offers high speeds and low latency compared to traditional satellite options. Visit <a href="https://www.starlink.com">Starlink.com</a> for subscription information.</p>
                
                <p><strong>HughesNet:</strong> Satellite internet service is available throughout the entire community. While speeds are typically slower than cable options, it may be suitable for basic internet needs.</p>

                <p><strong>Mobile Hotspots:</strong> Some residents use cellular hotspots from providers like Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile, particularly for weekend or occasional use. Coverage quality varies by location on the mountain.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4 class="highlight-box-title">INTERNET AVAILABILITY TIP</h4>
                <p>Before committing to a service provider, ask neighbors near your property about their experiences. Internet quality can vary dramatically even between properties on the same road due to terrain and tree coverage. Consider testing cellular signal strength at your property before choosing a mobile hotspot solution.</p>

                <p>If you plan to work remotely from Blue Mountain, consider these factors:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Request a service test before committing to a long-term contract</li>
                    <li>Consider having a backup internet option for critical work (e.g., both cable and mobile hotspot)</li>
                    <li>Power outages are more common in mountain areas, so a battery backup or generator may be necessary for consistent connectivity</li>
                    <li>Some residents install cell signal boosters to improve mobile hotspot performance</li>
                    <li>Check with your employer about minimum bandwidth requirements for remote work tools</li>
